## Waste Oil Request Letters
=====
Use any of the documents in this folder in any way you want for your benefit.
Free free to modify (add pretty graphics, new sentences, etc.) these items in ways you see fit.

You'll need to use a word processor that can handle the .fodt file type 
(LibreOffice or OpenOffice) in order to make changes to the .fodt documents.

Let me know if you see anything "wrong" with the files or if you have a letter
template that you would like to add to my list here to share with others.

God bless!
Matthew
